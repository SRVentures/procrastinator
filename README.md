# Procrastinator

You give it work to do, and it procrastinates, either waiting until the last
minute or until it has so much to do that is _has_ to do it.

See [hex docs](https://hexdocs.pm/procrastinator).

## Installation

The package can be installed as:

  1. Add `procrastinator` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
