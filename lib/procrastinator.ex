defmodule Procrastinator do
  @moduledoc """
  A behavior module for batching/procrastinating work.

  One procrastinator is defined per app. In the future this may change, but the
  original use was too aggregate results coming from multiple processes, so the
  underlying GenServer is assigned a name through the `name/0` callback, and so
  there will exist one instance per defined module that uses Procrastinator.

  The Procrastinator has a bucket, to which data can be added using the `push/1`
  method. If this causes the bucket to be full, `process/1` is called on the
  bucket. If this causes the bucket to overflow (eg, if the size of the bucket
  is measured in bytes), the current bucket will be processed and the data that
  was pushed will start the new bucket. If the bucket is not full, it won't do
  anything until `timeout/0` is reached, at which point it will process whatever
  is in the bucket.

  ## Example

  Assume you have thousands of processes all doing some work, and when each one
  is done you need to save the data to a third party service. This third party
  service can't handle saving all of that work one at a time, but it also can't
  handle saving one giant batch full of thousands of results. So we define a
  Procrastinator to batch the result sets into reasonable sizes.

      defmodule SaveToThirdParty do
        use Procrastinator

        @max_items 20
        @max_bytes 1024 * 256

        def process(bucket) do
          ThirdPartyApi.save_batch(bucket)
        end

        def timeout, do: 60_000

        def name, do: :save_to_third_party

        def status(bucket) do
          case length(bucket) do
            bucket_length when bucket_length == @max_items -> :full
            bucket_length when bucket_length > @max_items -> :overflow
            _ -> check_size(bucket)
          end
        end

        defp check_size(bucket) do
          case byte_size(Poison.encode!(bucket)) > @max_bytes do
            false -> :continue
            true when length(data) == 1 -> :full
            _ -> :overflow
          end
        end

      SaveToThirdParty.start_link
      SaveToThirdParty.push(1)

  In this scenario, we the processes can be slow, so we want to wait a minute
  before sending a batch to give it a chance to fill up all the way. The volume
  of processes ensures that the timeout won't be reached until most of them
  have already finished and just the stragglers are running.

  The maximum number of items the api can handle at a time is 20. On top of
  this, the maximum payload size we want to send over the wire is 256kb. To
  handle this, we use the `status/1` callback. If the length of `data` (the
  bucket) equals 20, we send back `:full`. If it is over 20, we send
  `:overflow`. In this example that can't happen, but it's here for
  completeness. Otherwise we check the size in bytes of the bucket, and follow
  the same logic: if the byte size is less than 256kb, we return `:continue`. If
  it's equal to it we return `:full`, and otherwise we return `:overflow`.

  This all ensures that the third party service never receives a batch bigger
  than in can handle. It also ensures that _most of the time_ it will receive a
  batch exactly equal to what it can handle.

  ## Starting
  The Procrastinator given in the example can be started using the `start_link`
  function. It can also be added as a worker to a supervision tree, for example:

      children = [
        supervisor(YourApp.Endpoint, []),
        worker(YourApp.SaveToThirdParty, [])
      ]

      opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: YourApp.Supervisor]
      Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)

  ## Returns
    * `:continue` - the Procrastinator will continue Procrastinating until
      `timeout/0` is reached.
    * `:full` - `process/1` will be called with the bucket that was passed to
      `status/1`, and the Procrastinator will be given a new, empty bucket.
    * `:overflow` - `process/1` will be called with the Procrastinator's current
